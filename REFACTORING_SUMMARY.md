# City Pollution API Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring work completed to make services class-based for better dependency injection and code reusability, and to make the 'state' field on the City model optional.

## Changes Made

### 1. Made 'state' Field Optional

#### Database Model (`city_pollution/db/models/city.py`)
- Changed `Column("state", String(255), nullable=False)` to `Column("state", String(255), nullable=True)`

#### Entity (`city_pollution/entities/city.py`)
- Changed `state: str` to `state: Optional[str]`

#### Schema (`city_pollution/schemas/city.py`)
- Changed `state: str` to `state: Optional[str] = None`

#### Database Migration
- Created migration file `city_pollution/alembic/versions/2a3b4c5d6e7f_make_state_optional.py`
- Migration alters the 'state' column to be nullable

### 2. Refactored Services to be Class-Based

#### GeocoderService (`city_pollution/services/geocoder_service.py`)
- **Before**: Function-based service with `get_reverse_geocode()` and `get_city_by_name()` functions
- **After**: Class-based service with:
  - `GeocoderServiceInterface` abstract base class
  - `GeocoderService` concrete implementation
  - Dependency injection support for geocoder instance
  - Legacy function wrappers for backward compatibility

#### OpenWeatherService (`city_pollution/services/openweather_service.py`)
- **Before**: Function-based service with `get_pollution_data()` function
- **After**: Class-based service with:
  - `OpenWeatherServiceInterface` abstract base class
  - `OpenWeatherService` concrete implementation
  - Configurable API key and base URL
  - Legacy function wrapper for backward compatibility

#### CityService (`city_pollution/services/city.py`)
- **Before**: Function-based service with multiple utility functions
- **After**: Class-based service with:
  - `CityServiceInterface` abstract base class
  - `CityService` concrete implementation
  - Dependency injection for `GeocoderService`
  - All original functionality preserved as methods
  - Legacy function wrappers for backward compatibility
  - Updated to handle optional state field

#### PollutionService (`city_pollution/services/pollution.py`)
- **Before**: Function-based service with multiple pollution-related functions
- **After**: Class-based service with:
  - `PollutionServiceInterface` abstract base class
  - `PollutionService` concrete implementation
  - Dependency injection for `OpenWeatherService` and `CityService`
  - All original functionality preserved as methods
  - Legacy function wrappers for backward compatibility

### 3. Dependency Injection System (`city_pollution/dependencies.py`)

Added new dependency injection functions:
- `get_geocoder_service()` - Returns singleton `GeocoderService` instance
- `get_openweather_service()` - Returns singleton `OpenWeatherService` instance
- `get_city_service()` - Returns singleton `CityService` instance
- `get_pollution_service()` - Returns singleton `PollutionService` instance

These functions use global variables to maintain singleton instances and handle proper dependency injection between services.

### 4. Updated Routers

#### City Router (`city_pollution/routers/city.py`)
- Updated imports to use new dependency injection
- Modified `find_city_by_name()` to use class-based `CityService`

#### Pollution Router (`city_pollution/routers/pollution.py`)
- Updated imports to use new dependency injection
- Modified all endpoints to use class-based `PollutionService`:
  - `get_pollution_data()`
  - `import_historical_pollution_by_coords()`
  - `delete_pollution_data()`

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. Better Dependency Injection
- Services can now be easily injected with their dependencies
- Easier to mock services for testing
- Clear dependency relationships between services

### 2. Improved Code Reusability
- Services are now proper classes that can be instantiated with different configurations
- Interface-based design allows for easy swapping of implementations
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. Enhanced Testability
- Class-based services are easier to unit test
- Dependencies can be easily mocked
- Each service has a clear interface contract

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- All original function-based APIs are preserved as legacy wrappers
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- Gradual migration path available

### 5. Flexible State Handling
- The 'state' field is now optional, allowing for cities without state information
- Handles cases where geocoding services don't provide state data
- More robust data handling

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- New code should use the class-based services via dependency injection
- Legacy function calls are deprecated but still functional
- Use `get_*_service()` functions from dependencies for new implementations

### For Database
- Run the alembic migration to update the database schema:
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```

### Testing
- All services compile successfully
- Dependency injection system is functional
- Routers updated to use new service architecture

## Future Improvements

1. **Remove Legacy Functions**: After ensuring all code uses the new class-based services, remove the legacy function wrappers
2. **Add Service Configuration**: Allow services to be configured via environment variables or configuration files
3. **Implement Service Registry**: Consider implementing a more sophisticated service registry pattern
4. **Add Caching**: Implement caching at the service level for better performance
5. **Add Metrics**: Add monitoring and metrics to services for better observability
